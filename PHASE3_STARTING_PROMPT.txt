I'm continuing development of Mammon, an autonomous DeFi yield optimization agent. We just completed Phase 3 (Uniswap V3 swap integration) with our FIRST REAL SWAP successfully executed on-chain! 🎉

CURRENT STATUS - Phase 3 Complete ✅:
- Transaction Hash: 0x1be8a8788a699ff4f11fe0b9fa91b2b363adb3b11c2ea5bcc5636c9b735f436b
- Network: Base Sepolia
- Swap: 0.0001 ETH → 0.327356 USDC
- All 8 security checks: PASSED
- Block confirmations: 2
- Status: MAMMON IS LIVE AND TRADING

WHAT'S WORKING:
✅ Local wallet with BIP-39 seed (transaction signing operational)
✅ Uniswap V3 swap execution (SwapRouter02)
✅ 8-layer security framework (quote, oracle, slippage, gas, approval, simulation)
✅ WalletManager integration (real on-chain execution)
✅ Price oracles (Chainlink + mock fallback)
✅ Gas estimation (accurate cost prediction)
✅ Comprehensive logging and error handling
✅ Scaling validated (tested with 10x larger swap)

ARCHITECTURE READY:
- src/blockchain/swap_executor.py (400+ lines, production-ready)
- src/blockchain/wallet.py (wallet management, transaction signing)
- src/protocols/uniswap_v3_*.py (quoter, router integration)
- src/security/* (approval, limits, audit logging)
- Complete test suite (integration + unit tests)

NEXT MISSION - Phase 3: Yield Optimization 🎯:
Transform Mammon from swap executor to autonomous yield optimizer that:
1. Monitors yields across lending protocols (Morpho, Aave V3, Moonwell)
2. Calculates net returns after gas costs
3. Executes profitable rebalancing automatically
4. Maximizes user returns with institutional security

STARTING POINT - Sprint 1 (Days 1-2):
We're beginning with Protocol Integration Foundation:
1. Create BaseProtocol abstract class (unified interface)
2. Integrate Morpho lending protocol (Coinbase-promoted, start simple)
3. Build protocol data models (Position, Yield, etc.)
4. Add position tracking to database
5. Write integration tests

KEY FILES TO READ:
- PHASE3_KICKOFF.md (complete implementation guide with all 6 sprints)
- HISTORIC_FIRST_SWAP.md (our successful swap execution details)
- CLAUDE.md (project architecture and principles)
- src/blockchain/swap_executor.py (reference for security patterns)

TECHNICAL APPROACH:
- Start with READ-ONLY protocol integration (safe)
- Reuse existing security framework from swap_executor
- Build transaction sequencing for multi-step operations
- Conservative position limits ($100-1000 to start)
- LangGraph orchestration for autonomous operation

SECURITY PRIORITIES:
- Protocol risk scoring (audits, TVL, age, exploit history)
- Position limits per protocol
- Exact approvals (never unlimited, always revoke)
- Emergency withdrawal mechanism
- Simulation before every execution

TIMELINE:
- Sprint 1-2: Protocol scanning (2-4 days)
- Sprint 3-4: Optimization logic (4-6 days)
- Sprint 5-6: Autonomous agent (3-5 days)
- Total: 9-15 days to first autonomous yield optimization

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
Phase 3 complete when Mammon can:
✅ Monitor yields across 3+ protocols
✅ Calculate net returns including gas costs
✅ Execute profitable rebalancing
✅ Operate autonomously for 48 hours
✅ Generate positive net yield after costs

CURRENT WALLET:
- Address: 0x81A2933C185e45f72755B35110174D57b5E1FC88
- Network: Base Sepolia (testnet)
- Balance: ~0.0996 ETH remaining

Please help me start Phase 3 Sprint 1 by:
1. Reading PHASE3_KICKOFF.md for the complete plan
2. Creating the BaseProtocol abstract class
3. Beginning Morpho protocol integration (read-only first)
4. Setting up the protocol data models

Let's build Mammon into a true autonomous yield optimization agent! 🚀
